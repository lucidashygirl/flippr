## About

This is an old game I made that will soon be replaced by a better version. Will link to
it when it's complete, or at least public ready.

## Installation

All builds are just standalone executables, self explanatory.

## How to play

The controls are the following:

- Z / Lower Face Button => Flip
- X / Right Face Button => Restart
- A / Left Face Button => Previous Level
- S / Upper Face Button => Next Level
- (Escape / Capslock) / Start => Exit

Notes:
- The bugs present in this build are either minor quirks that have already been fixed in 
the new version or are intentional hidden mechanics... so don't report them! >:3 
(unless you just cant launch the game, which might happen for windows and arm linux builds since i didnt test them)
- This game is not very accessible. This will be addressed in the new version, 
with easier to distinguish sprites and game speed modifiers and such.
